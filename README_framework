                G53DIA Tanker Environment
                =========================

Getting Started
---------------

You can use the Makefile in the top-level directory to (re)build the project. 

To compile the environment, on UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X or any other system
using GNUMake simply use the command:
           
make                 

Other make targets:
 make classes           -- Just builds the class files (no jar)
 make docs               -- Builds javadoc in docs/
 make tags              -- Builds ctags file (for vi users)
 make clean             -- Removes class files and jar
 make distclean         -- Removes docs and tags too
 make test              -- Runs the demo
 make demo              -- Makes the demo

For Windows - you can download GNUMake from:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm (not tested, but
should work ...)

Alternatively a simple MS-DOS file is provided to automate common
tasks, it's usage is:

 dosmake env		-- Builds the environment
 dosmake demo		-- Builds the demo tanker
 dosmake jar		-- Builds an executable jar file (of everything)
 dosmake test		-- Runs the demo


To begin, run these commands *in the order listed above*.


Overview
--------

The package contains a basic environment, consisting of a grid of
cells, some bins and stations, a litter agent interface, and some graphical
user interface components. In addition, there is sample implementation
of the litter agent interface which picks actions at random and a sample
wrapper class which creates a GUI window (so that you can see what the
agent is doing) and executes the agent in the environment. The
sample litter agent picks actions at random, and so is not very successful.
The easiest way to get started is to simply edit the file
src/uk/ac/nott/cs/g53dia/demo/DemoLitterAgent.java and write your own agent
code in there. To implement the abstract LitterAgent class, you provide an
implementation of the single senseAndAct method. This method is called
on each time-step with what the agent can currently sense nearby in
the environment, and it should return a single Action object
representing the action that the tanker wants to carry out in this
cycle. The GUI component is also quite primitive, so you'll probably
want to print debug messages to the console as well (or improve the
component).


LIMITATIONS
===========

The GUI components are rather limited in the information they display.
If you need more information, then System.out.println is the easiest
way for now.
